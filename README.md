Do you need to add a lightweight widget on your site that displays **real time** stock data?

This project was built with:

- [Vanilla JS](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Stock API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/)
